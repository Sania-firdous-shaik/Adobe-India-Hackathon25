# Connecting the Dots Hackathon

## Overview

Welcome to the “Connecting the Dots” Hackathon! This challenge focuses on reinventing the traditional PDF format by creating intelligent and interactive document experiences.

## Challenge Structure

- **Round 1:**  
  Extract structured outlines from PDF documents with high precision and speed. Implement offline, CPU-only solutions that understand document sections and link related ideas.

- **Round 2:**  
  Build an intuitive web application to showcase your Round 1 work, creating an engaging and contextual reading interface.

## Importance

In today's world of abundant documents, providing meaningful context to content is essential. This hackathon aims to build tools that enable smarter, more interactive reading and analysis experiences.

## What You Will Build

- High-quality document structure extractors.
- Systems that intelligently link related sections.
- Modular and reusable codebases.
- Solutions that run offline within specified resource limits.

## Technical Requirements

- Offline CPU-only execution.
- Dockerized solution for ease of deployment.
- Compliance with model size and runtime constraints.

## Submission Guidelines

- Complete code repository including a working Dockerfile at the root.
- All dependencies should be installed inside the container.
- A README detailing your approach, tools/libraries used, and instructions to build and run your solution.
- Output files and other deliverables should follow the submission instructions.

## Tips

- Avoid relying solely on font size or type for heading detection.
- Test your solution across diverse document types and languages.
- Modularize your code for easier reuse.
- Do not hardcode inputs or outputs.
- Ensure no network calls are made during solution execution.

Good luck with your submission!
