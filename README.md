# Adobe India Hackathon 2025
## Welcome to the "Connecting the Dots" Challenge

## overview
This challenge focuses on reinventing the traditional PDF format by creating intelligent and interactive document experiences.hat if every time you opened a PDF, it didn't just sit there—it spoke to you, connected ideas, and narrated meaning across your entire library?

That's the future we're building — and we want you to help shape it.

In the Connecting the Dots Challenge, your mission is to reimagine the humble PDF as an intelligent, interactive experience—one that understands structure, surfaces insights, and responds to you like a trusted research companion.

## Challenge Structure

- **Round 1:**  
  Extract structured outlines from PDF documents with high precision and speed. Implement offline, CPU-only solutions that understand document sections and link related ideas.

- **Round 2:**  
  Build an intuitive web application to showcase your Round 1 work, creating an engaging and contextual reading interface.

## Importance

In today's world of abundant documents, providing meaningful context to content is essential. This hackathon aims to build tools that enable smarter, more interactive reading and analysis experiences.

## What You Will Build

- High-quality document structure extractors.
- Systems that intelligently link related sections.
- Modular and reusable codebases.
- Solutions that run offline within specified resource limits.

## Technical Requirements

- Offline CPU-only execution.
- Dockerized solution for ease of deployment.
- Compliance with model size and runtime constraints.

## Submission Guidelines

- Complete code repository including a working Dockerfile at the root.
- All dependencies should be installed inside the container.
- A README detailing your approach, tools/libraries used, and instructions to build and run your solution.
- Output files and other deliverables should follow the submission instructions.

## Tips

- Avoid relying solely on font size or type for heading detection.
- Test your solution across diverse document types and languages.
- Modularize your code for easier reuse.
- Do not hardcode inputs or outputs.
- Ensure no network calls are made during solution execution.
